implement role verification on each request.References:  \n\nsrc/app/services/auth.service.ts:L1–L35  \nsrc/app/guards/auth.guard.ts:L1–L24  \nsrc/app/models/role.ts:L1–L5\n\n\n[D2] Role-Based Routing with Path Segmentation\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need to separate user experiences by role while maintaining clear URL structure and preventing unauthorized access.Options Considered: Single route with role-based rendering, role-specific subdomains, path-based role separationDecision: Path-based role separation (/traveller, /approver, /finance) with authGuard protection.Rationale: Clear URL structure, easy to understand, simple guard implementation, natural separation of concerns.Implications: Route duplication for similar functionality, potential for code duplication in role-specific components.Fallback/Next Steps: Consider feature-based routing if role-specific logic becomes too divergent.References:  \n\nsrc/app/app.routes.ts:L1–L69  \nsrc/app/guards/auth.guard.ts:L1–L24\n\n\n[D3] Service-Based State with localStorage Persistence\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for data persistence without backend, requiring state management across components and user sessions.Options Considered: NgRx store, Angular signals, service-based with localStorage, in-memory onlyDecision: Service-based state management with localStorage persistence for trips and expenses.Rationale: Simplicity over complexity, no external dependencies, immediate persistence, familiar Angular patterns.Implications: No real-time updates, potential data inconsistency across tabs, limited scalability, localStorage size constraints.Fallback/Next Steps: Migrate to NgRx when real-time updates and complex state interactions are needed.References:  \n\nsrc/app/services/trip.service.ts:L1–L100  \nsrc/app/services/auth.service.ts:L1–L35\n\n\n[D4] Standalone Components with Clear Hierarchy\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for modular, maintainable components that can be easily tested and reused across different role contexts.Options Considered: NgModule-based architecture, standalone components, hybrid approachDecision: Angular 17 standalone components with clear parent-child hierarchy for expense operations.Rationale: Modern Angular approach, better tree-shaking, simpler testing, clear component boundaries, no module complexity.Implications: Potential for import duplication, need for careful dependency management, learning curve for team.Fallback/Next Steps: Consider NgModules if component complexity increases significantly.References:  \n\nsrc/app/components/expense-modal/expense-modal.ts:L1–L40  \nsrc/app/components/trip-detail-view/trip-detail-view.ts:L1–L50  \nsrc/app/components/expense-form/expense-form.ts:L1–L30\n\n\n[D5] Event-Driven Communication via @Output/@Input\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for loose coupling between components while maintaining clear data flow for expense operations.Options Considered: Service-based communication, input binding, event emitters, shared stateDecision: Use @Input for passing data down to child components and @Output event emitters for propagating actions upward to parent components. Parent components then invoke services to handle the business logic or API calls.Rationale: - Maintains component independence — no direct references between sibling components.  \n\nKeeps data flow unidirectional and explicit, which aids debugging and maintenance.  \nSimplifies unit testing by allowing component events to be easily mocked or intercepted.Implications: Event chain complexity (ExpenseForm → ExpenseModal → TripDetailView → TripDetail), potential for lost events.Fallback/Next Steps: Consider service-based communication if event chains become too complex.References:  \nsrc/app/components/expense-form/expense-form.ts:L200–L300  \nsrc/app/components/expense-modal/expense-modal.ts:L40–L100  \nsrc/app/components/trip-detail-view/trip-detail-view.ts:L60–L100\n\n\n[D6] Reactive Forms with Custom Validation\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for complex form validation across different expense types with dynamic field requirements.Options Considered: Template-driven forms, reactive forms, hybrid approachDecision: Reactive forms with custom validators for expense type-specific validation.Rationale: Better validation control, dynamic form generation, easier testing, type safety with TypeScript.Implications: More boilerplate code, steeper learning curve, potential for complex form state management.Fallback/Next Steps: Consider template-driven forms for simpler forms if validation requirements decrease.References:  \n\nsrc/app/components/expense-form/expense-form.ts:L1–L100  \nsrc/app/pages/end-user/create-trip/create-trip.ts:L1–L50\n\n\n[D7] Centralized Services with localStorage Persistence\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for centralized business logic and data persistence without external dependencies.Options Considered: Multiple specialized services, single monolithic service, service per featureDecision: Two centralized services: AuthService for authentication, TripService for trip/expense management.Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, easy to maintain, simple dependency injection, centralized data access.Implications: Services become large, potential for tight coupling, difficult to test individual features.Fallback/Next Steps: Split into feature-specific services when individual services exceed 300+ lines.References:  \n\nsrc/app/services/auth.service.ts:L1–L35  \nsrc/app/services/trip.service.ts:L1–L100\n\n\n[D8] Modal Orchestration with Component Composition\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for expense operations (create, view, edit, delete) without navigation, maintaining context and user experience.Options Considered: Separate routes for each operation, inline forms, modal-based approachDecision: Modal-based expense operations with component composition (ExpenseModal → ExpenseForm).Rationale: Better user experience, maintains context, no navigation complexity, reusable modal component.Implications: Complex modal state management, potential for modal state bugs, accessibility challenges.Fallback/Next Steps: Consider route-based approach if modal complexity increases significantly.References:  \n\nsrc/app/components/expense-modal/expense-modal.ts:L1–L40  \nsrc/app/components/expense-form/expense-form.ts:L1–L30  \nsrc/app/components/trip-detail-view/trip-detail-view.ts:L40–L60\n\n\n[D9] Minimal Testing with Focus on Core Functionality\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for rapid development and demonstration, with limited time for comprehensive testing infrastructure.Options Considered: Comprehensive unit testing, integration testing, minimal testing, TDD approachDecision: Minimal testing with focus on core functionality and component specifications.Rationale: Faster development, focus on working features, easier demonstration, reduced complexity.Implications: Potential for bugs in edge cases, difficult to refactor safely, technical debt accumulation.Fallback/Next Steps: Implement comprehensive testing when moving to production or when bug count increases.References:  \n\nsrc/app/app.spec.ts:L1–L26  \nsrc/app/pages/end-user/end-user.spec.ts:L1–L50\n\n\n[D10] Angular 17 Standalone Components with Budget Warnings\nStatus: AcceptedContext: Need for modern Angular features and optimal bundle size while maintaining development velocity.Options Considered: Angular 16 with NgModules, Angular 17 standalone, hybrid approachDecision: Angular 17 with standalone components and performance budgets.Rationale: Latest Angular features, better tree-shaking, modern development experience, performance monitoring.Implications: Budget warnings for SCSS files, potential for large bundles, need for optimization.Fallback/Next Steps: Optimize SCSS files, implement code splitting if bundle size becomes problematic.References:  \n\nsrc/app/app.config.ts:L1–L15  \nangular.json (performance budgets)\n\n\nOpen Questions & Risks\nSecurity Risks\n\nlocalStorage Tampering: Users can modify their role in localStorage, potentially accessing unauthorized features.\nNo Session Expiration: Authentication state persists indefinitely.\nClient-Side Validation: All validation occurs client-side and can be bypassed.\n\nData Consistency Risks\n\nMulti-tab Behavior: Changes in one tab may not reflect in others.\nlocalStorage Limits: Potential storage quota exceeded with large datasets.\nNo Conflict Resolution: No handling of concurrent modifications.\n\nScalability Concerns\n\nService Growth: TripService already at 274 lines, approaching maintainability limits.\nComponent Complexity: ExpenseModal component handles multiple responsibilities.\nEvent Chain Depth: Four-level event chain for expense operations.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching
